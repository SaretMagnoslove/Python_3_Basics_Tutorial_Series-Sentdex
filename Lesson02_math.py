# Here, we have some simple addition, the returned number is 4.
print(1+3)
# Next up, multiplication, fancy stuff! The return is 16.
print(4*4)
# Subtraction, even fancier. Return will be 3
print(5-2)
# Division, now this is actually fancy, based on Python's history.
print(5/2)
# There are other ways to do exponents, but this works just fine, 
# and is a familiar syntax for it.
print(4**4)
