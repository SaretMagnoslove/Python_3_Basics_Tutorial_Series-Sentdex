# The idea of multi-line printing in Python is to be able to easily print 
# across multiple lines, while only using 1 print function, while also printing 
# out exactly what you intend. Sometimes, when making something like a text-based 
# graphical user interface, it can be quite tedious and challenging to make everything 
# line up for you. This is where multi-line printing can be very useful.

comment, but it will print out.
