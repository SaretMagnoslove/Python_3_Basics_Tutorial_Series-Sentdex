# Here we've called our function example. 
# After the name of the function, you specify any parameters of that function within
# the parenthesis parameters act as variables within the function,
# they are not necessary to create a function, 
# so first let's just do this without any parameters.
def example():
    print('this code will run')
    z = 3 + 9
    print(z)
# Now if we just run this, we see nothing happens. 
# We have to actually call this function to execute, 
# because all we've done so far is just define the function and what it does. 
# To run it, you can either type out the function in the console like so:
example()
