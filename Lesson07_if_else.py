# So first we ask if x is greater than 55. 
# It is not, therefor the else statement runs.
x = 5
y = 8
if x > 55:
    print('x is greater than 55')
else:
    print('x is not greater than 55')
# If instead we do this:
x = 5
y = 8
if x < 55:
    print('x is less than 55')
else:
    print('x is not less than 55')
# ...asking if x is less than 55, which it is, so the else statement does not run.
