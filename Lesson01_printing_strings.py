# We're printing out a string. 
# Notice that the quotes are single quotes. 
# You can use single quotes or double quotes, but they need to be used together.
print('Single Quotes')
print("double quotes")
# You cannot use the "+" to join strings with ints or floats, you must use the ",".
print('can do this',5)
print('cannot do this:'+5)
# It is also important to bring up how to put quotes within strings.
# You can either put double quotes inside single quotes, singles inside doubles, 
# or use the "\" backslash. The \ character is known as an "escape" character, and 
# it will "escape" the characteristic of the following character and just take on the 
# 'visual' aspect of it. Here are some examples of quotation rules:
print('Can't do this')
print('you\'ll have success here')
print("you'll have success here too")
